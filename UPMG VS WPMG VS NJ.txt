Phylogenetic Tree Construction Methods

This repository includes multiple distance-based phylogenetic tree construction algorithms implemented from first principles in R, allowing direct comparison of their assumptions, behavior, and computational complexity.

Overview of Methods
Method	Tree Type	Assumption on Evolutionary Rate	Output
UPGMA	Rooted	Constant (molecular clock)	Ultrametric tree
WPGMA	Rooted	Constant (weighted equally)	Ultrametric tree
Neighbor-Joining (NJ)	Unrooted	No molecular clock assumption	Additive tree
UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)

UPGMA is a hierarchical clustering algorithm that builds a rooted, ultrametric tree by iteratively merging the closest pair of clusters and updating distances using a size-weighted arithmetic mean.

Key Characteristics

Assumes a strict molecular clock (equal evolutionary rates across lineages)

Produces equal root-to-tip distances

Sensitive to violations of clock-like evolution

Strengths

Simple and computationally efficient

Easy to interpret and visualize

Useful for teaching and exploratory analysis

Limitations

Biologically inaccurate when evolutionary rates vary

Can produce misleading topologies for real data

Time Complexity: O(n³)
Space Complexity: O(n²)

WPGMA (Weighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean)

WPGMA is closely related to UPGMA but differs in how distances are updated. Instead of weighting by cluster size, WPGMA weights all clusters equally, regardless of the number of sequences they contain.

Key Characteristics

Assumes a molecular clock

Treats merged clusters symmetrically

Produces a rooted ultrametric tree

Strengths

Conceptually simple

Useful for illustrating clustering strategies

Highlights the effect of weighting assumptions

Limitations

Even more sensitive to unequal evolutionary rates than UPGMA

Rarely used in modern phylogenetics for inference

Time Complexity: O(n³)
Space Complexity: O(n²)

Neighbor-Joining (NJ)

Neighbor-Joining is a distance-based algorithm designed to reconstruct phylogenies without assuming a molecular clock. It identifies pairs of taxa that minimize total tree length using a Q-matrix, producing an unrooted additive tree.

Key Characteristics

Does not assume equal evolutionary rates

Estimates branch lengths explicitly

Produces unrooted trees (can be rooted post-hoc)

Strengths

More biologically realistic than UPGMA/WPGMA

Performs well on real sequence data

Widely used in phylogenetics and comparative genomics

Limitations

Computationally more complex

Still distance-based (information loss vs likelihood methods)

Time Complexity: O(n³)
Space Complexity: O(n²)

Educational and Research Context

These implementations are intended to:

Demonstrate core phylogenetic algorithms step-by-step

Highlight how model assumptions affect tree topology

Provide readable, well-annotated reference code for bioinformatics education

Support comparative analysis in computational biology coursework

For large-scale or production phylogenetics, optimized libraries (e.g., PHYLIP, MEGA, APE) are recommended. However, implementing these algorithms from scratch offers valuable insight into how phylogenetic inference works under the hood.
